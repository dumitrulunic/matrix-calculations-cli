# A python CLI tool for working with matrices


Hereâ€™s a sample README.md for your CLI tool that works with matrices in Python:

Matrix Operations CLI Tool
A Python CLI for Performing Matrix Operations
This tool provides a variety of matrix operations using the power of NumPy. Whether you're dealing with basic operations like addition or advanced ones like eigenvalue decomposition, this tool will help you perform those calculations with ease. The tool can also visualize matrices and matrix operations for better understanding.

## Features

- Add two matrices
- Subtract two matrices
- Multiply two matrices
- Multiply a matrix by a scalar

- Transpose a matrix
- Calculate the determinant of a matrix
- Calculate the inverse of a matrix
- Perform eigenvalue decomposition
- Rank of a matrix
- LU and QR decomposition
- Matrix exponentiation

- Check if a matrix is symmetric
- Check if a matrix is orthogonal

- Heatmap visualization of matrices using matplotlib
- Visualizing matrix transformations (like scaling, rotation)
